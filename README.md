# etch-a-sketch

This project is going to be a demonstration of my understanding of creating interactive
javascript code.

This project conists of an interactive page that:
  - asks the user for a grid size
  - create a grid based on that number
  - have each section of the grid interact with the mouse when it hovers over each div
  - change the colors of the individual divs
  - allow the user to reset the grid
